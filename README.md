Welcome to **TeamNexis**, a personal innovation space run by me — **Siddhartha**, a Class 11 student passionate about AI, code, and the endless possibilities of technology.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm currently preparing for IIT JEE while actively exploring the world of programming and artificial intelligence. What started as a hobby has become a mission — to build powerful, meaningful, and creative tech projects.

From smart bots to Arduino setups, I do it all solo under the banner of **TeamNexis** — because every big vision starts with one mind daring to think different.
